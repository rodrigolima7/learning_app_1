# Simple Learning Application 1
This is just a simple application I created to solidify my current knowledge 
of the JavaScript multi-verse.
Feel free to read and use the code presented here.

## Fase 1: Making a simple commit to GitHub from a blank project
For this initial moment, my intent is to use `npm init` to create a simple 
`packages.json` file, this `README.md` file, push it to GitHub and create a tag for 
later reference.<br>

This phase is also useful to further my knowledge in the Markdown sintax.
I found the following links that helped me better understand the sintax and how to use it:

* [Mastering Markdown - GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Daring Fireball's Markdown Syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
